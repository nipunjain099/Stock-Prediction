# This folder includes a sentiment analysis pipline

The required files for the pipline are:
### raw_sentiment.csv

### stock_price.csv
This can be downloaded from yahoo finance. This file has two columns, with the first column being date and second being price
stock_price.csv can be found in ../us_stock_data/raw_stock_price
